Machine Learning with Python Programming Language Using A List of Key Libraries Including Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Sklearn

In this project you will try to create machine learning models using python step-by-step. You will:

1. Download and install Python Scipy and get the most useful package for machine learning in Python
2. Load a dataset and try to understand its structure using statistical summaries and data visualization
3. Create 6 machine learning models and then pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is realible


So let's get started!
