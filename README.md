# python-machine-learning
Machine Learning with Python Programming Language Using A List of Key Libraries Including Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Sklearn.

In this small project I created machine learning models using python step-by-step. I'm done trying to:

1. Download and install Python Scipy and get the most useful package for machine learning in Python
2. Load a dataset and try to understand its structure using statistical summaries and data visualization
3. Create 6 machine learning models and then pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable

The problem solved by this small project is about classification of iris flowers (e.g. <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris" target="_blank">the iris dataset</a>). I'm done looking at two types of plots data:

1. Univerate plots to better understand each attribute, including box-whisker plots and histograms
2. Multivariate plots to better understand the relationships between attributes, including scatter plot matrix


The project doesn't cover all of the steps in a machine learning project because of focus on the key four steps. Namely, loading data, looking at the data, evaluating some most common algorithms and making some prediction (not including data preparation and result improvement tasks).
