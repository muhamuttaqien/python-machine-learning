Machine Learning with Python Programming Language Using A List of Key Libraries Including Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Sklearn

In this small project I created machine learning models using python step-by-step. I'm done trying to:

1. Download and install Python Scipy and get the most useful package for machine learning in Python
2. Load a dataset and try to understand its structure using statistical summaries and data visualization
3. Create 6 machine learning models and then pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable

The problem solved by this small project is about classification of iris flowers (e.g. <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris">the iris dataset</a>)
